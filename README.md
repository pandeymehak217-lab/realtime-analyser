## 🔹 Key Features

* **Real-time Object Detection and Tracking**
* **Speed & Motion Analysis:** Calculates speed in km/h or other relevant units.
* **Counting & Analytics:** Provides detailed counts and statistics per object class/type.
* **Customizable Detection Models:** Easily integrate different YOLO models for specific tasks.
* **Lightweight and Efficient:** Designed for high-performance processing on standard hardware.

## 🏁 Getting Started

To get the project running, follow these simple steps in your terminal:

1.  **Clone the repo**:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/pandeymehak217-lab/realtime-analyser.git](https://github.com/pandeymehak217-lab/realtime-analyser.git)
    cd Realtime-Analyser
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Run Analyzer on a Video (CLI Mode):**
    ```bash
    python main.py --video path_to_video.mp4
    ```
4.  **Run the Web Dashboard (Recommended for Interactive Use):**
    ```bash
    streamlit run dashboard.py
    ```

## 🖥️ Web Dashboard (Interactive Analysis)

The project includes an **interactive web dashboard**, typically accessible at **`http://localhost:8501/`**, which provides a user-friendly interface for the Realtime-Analyser.

This dashboard allows users to:

* **Upload** or specify a video source easily.
* **Visualize** the real-time object detection and tracking output directly in the browser.
* View **live statistics** (counts, speed, etc.) updated dynamically as the analysis runs.

Use the command `streamlit run dashboard.py` (Step 4 in **Getting Started**) to launch this interactive tool.
